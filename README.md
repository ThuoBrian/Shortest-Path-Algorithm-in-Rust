# Shortest-Path-Algorithm-in-Rust

This project demonstrates the implementation of shortest path algorithms in Rust, using the [`petgraph`](https://crates.io/crates/petgraph) crate for graph data structures and algorithms.

## Features

- Example code for finding shortest paths in graphs
- Uses Rust's modern ecosystem and safe programming features

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Shortest-Path-Algorithm-in-Rust.git
   cd Shortest-Path-Algorithm-in-Rust
   ```

2. **Build and run:**
   ```sh
   cargo run
   ```

## Dependencies

- [petgraph](https://crates.io/crates/petgraph) (see [Cargo.toml](Cargo.toml))
